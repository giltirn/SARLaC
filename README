Statistical Analysis and Regression for Lattice Calculations (SARLaC) 
is a modern C++ framework and set of tools for data analysis primarily aimed at lattice QCD. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Components include:
	   - Resampling (bootstrap, jackknife) of data for standard error estimation, etc with data encapsulated in 
             "distribution" objects, following a strategy developed by Peter Boyle for UKfit
	   - Non-linear regression functionality for scalar and array (distribution) data types with a built-in optimal
             solver and optional linkage to other fit libraries
	   - Goodness of fit estimation by chi^2 and Hotelling T^2 as well as a bootstrap-based technique for general 
             null distributions
	   - Expression-template based manipulation of distribution objects for optimized analysis
	   - Functionality to automatically generate Python MatPlotLib scripts containing analysis results
	   - Convenience wrappers around BLAS functionality commonly used for analysis include matrix inversion, 
             (generalized-)eigenvalue computation, etc
	   - Serialization of data objects in binary format via HDF5 wrappers
	   - A rich parser for inputting configuration to applications


*********** Installation via Spack ********************

git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
git clone https://github.com/giltirn/SARLaC.git

source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh  #setup spack. Do this every time

### Do this stuff the first time only ######
spack compiler find                                                       #get spack to find your compiler
spack external find                                                       #get spack to locate safe, preinstalled librarier
spack repo add SARLaC/spack/repo/sarlac                                   #add the SARLaC repo
spack install sarlac ^hdf5~mpi                                            #Install. Note the latter just tells spack not to install the mpi version of hdf5, which takes longer and builds openmpi
